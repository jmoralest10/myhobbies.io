  <h1>Jonathan Morales Hobbies</h1>

    <p>
    Hello, I am Jonathan Morales and I will tell you about my personal hobbies. Everything I enjoy
doing is revolved around soccer or football as it’s known around the world. As most Mexican’s, I 
grew with the sport in my home, and I feel in love with it.  I have always enjoy playing to this date. 
I started coaching soccer at the age of 15, so I could become my two younger brothers coach. I
enjoy watching both of them play on weekends and cheer them on. When I am home with some
free time I spend time playing FIFA the video game.

      <h3>Playing the Game</h3>

      <p>Even though I grew up loving the sport, I didn't start playing on a team until age 10. I only played in a competitive environment for a couple years because it took away the fun for me. I always wanted to play just for fun.I still play pick up games every Sunday.</p>

      <h3>Coaching the Game</h3>
        <img src="images/coaching.jpg">
      <p> I began coaching at age 15. My brothers team coach had left so I decided to take the job. It was at the recreational level but I believe I helped kids have a great understanding of the game. I also helped develop my two brothers. One plays college soccer at the moment and the other one is on path to do so as well. Currently taking a break from coaching. I hope to return soon but this time at the youth club level!</p>

      <h3>Watching the Game</h3>
        <img src="images/trophy.jpg">
      <p>I enjoy wathching as well wether it is on television or live in person. I would go to Mexico every summer to get to see some games of my favorite team in person. But my favorite games are both my brother's games. I try to go to every single one of them. My favorite memory is going to Reno, NV and watch them win their second high school state championship. </p>
